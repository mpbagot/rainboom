# Rainboom Render Engine

Rainboom is my own 3D rendering engine written in Python and utilises the Pygame library to draw to screen. Once the engine is feature-complete, it will be implemented in a few of my code projects which require 3D graphics.

### Feature Todo:
 - ~~Fix 3D vertex projection~~ (COMPLETE)
 - ~~Implement wireframe rendering~~ (COMPLETE)
 - ~~Add basic Quads and N-gons~~ (COMPLETE)
 - Implement solid colour faces
 - ~~Add backface/occlusion culling~~ (COMPLETE)
 - Implement shadow mapping
 - Implement simple flat shading
 - Implement Gouraud smooth shading
 - Implement texturing for faces
